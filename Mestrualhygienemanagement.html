A menstrual pad is a type of feminine hygiene product that is worn externally, unlike tampons and menstrual cups which are worn inside the vagina. The pad has to be changed several times in 24 hours depending on whether menstrual flow is heavy or light.

    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color: azure"><h2 style="color: deeppink">Reusable Menstrual Pads/cloth</h2><p>Cloth menstrual pads are cloth pads worn in the underwear to prevent menstrual fluidfrom leaking onto clothes. They are a type of reusable menstrual hygiene product, and are an alternative to disposable sanitary napkins or to menstrual cups. They are less expensive than disposable pads and reduce the amount of waste produced.
Generally they are made from layers of absorbent fabrics (such as cotton or hemp) After use, they are washed, dried and then reused.</p></div>
        
        
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color: antiquewhite"><h2 style="color: deeppink">Menstrual Cups</h2><p>A menstrual cup is a type of reusable feminine hygiene product. Itâ€™s a small, flexible funnel-shaped cup made of rubber or silicone that you insert into your vagina to catch and collect period fluid.
Cups can hold more blood than other methods, leading many women to use them as an eco-friendly alternative to tampons. And depending on your flow, you can wear a cup for up to 12 hours.</p><img src="img/images%20(3).jpeg" width=80% height=20%></div>
    <div class="col-md-3" style="background-color: azure"><p style="color: deeppink"><h2 style="color: deeppink">Tampons</h2><p><p>A tampon is a menstrual product designed to absorb blood and vaginal secretions by insertion into the vagina during menstruation. Unlike a pad, it is placed internally, inside of the vaginal canal. Once inserted correctly, a tampon is held in place by the vagina and expands as it soaks up menstrual blood.

        <ul></ul>
        <ul li style="color: black">1. Change your sanitary napkin every 4-6 hours Changing sanitary napkins or tampons within every 4-6 hours is the cardinal rule to establish vaginal hygiene. Menstrual blood, when released from the body attracts various organisms from our bodies, which multiply in the warmth of the blood, and cause irritation, rashes or urinary tract infections. Changing your sanitary napkin or tampon regularly curbs the growth of these organisms and prevents infections.</ul>
        <ul li style="color: black">2. Wash yourself properly Washing your vagina regularly is extremely important, because the organisms cling to your body after you have removed your sanitary napkin. Most people wash themselves regularly, but not the right way--which is, using your hands in motion from the vagina to the anus, not vice-versa.  Motioning  your hand from the anus to the vagina can lead to the transmission of the bacteria from the anus into the vagina or urethra opening  leading to infections.</ul>
        <ul li style="color: black">3. Don't use soaps or vagina hygiene products- while using vaginal hygiene products everyday is a good idea, using these products during menses can turn things around. Vaginas have their own cleaning mechanism which comes into play during menstrual cycles, and these artificial hygiene products can hamper the natural process leading to infections and growth of bacteria.</ul>
        <ul li style="color: black">4. Discard the sanitary napkin properly-
Disposing off your tampons and sanitary napkins properly is an important step. Wrap them properly before you throw them away, so the bacteria and infections do not spread.  Make sure you don't flush them, since that  will block the toilet causing the water to back up, spreading the bacteria all over it.  Washing your hands properly is of utmost importance after you have wrapped and discarded the used tampons and sanitary napkins, since you're likely to touch the stained area while wrapping them.</ul>
        <ul li style="color: black">Stick to one method of sanitation-
Women tend to use tampons and sanitary napkins, or two sanitary napkins simultaneously during heavy flow which is an efficient technique. While it may keep you dry and prevent stained clothes, it can cause infections too. The combination of two techniques absorbs the blood making us oblivious to the need to change our tampons and sanitary napkins. Without frequent change, the accumulated blood invites bacteria and causes infections. So, it is advisable to use one sanitary napkin and change it as frequently as you can during heavy flow. These cardinal rules will help you stay healthy and manage your period better.</ul>
