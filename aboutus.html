    Adey Abeba is a project that helps create awareness about menstrual hygiene management in Ethiopia which aims to improve the lives of girls and women by ensuring access to menstrual hygiene management information and products. We thrive to break walls of discrimination, neglect and shame that follows menstruation in our country.
Having access to Menstrual hygiene products is a human right and based on sustainable developmental goal of UN we target to Ensuring healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages and gender and empower women along the way. 
We are devoted to bring about a society that is more aware about Menstrual health and management and shed some light on the issue to the community and concerning bodies.
