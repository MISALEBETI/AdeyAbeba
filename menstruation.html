    <p> Menstruation also known as a period or monthly is the regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue (known as menses) from the inner lining of the uterus through the vagina.During a normal menstrual cycle, the lining of a woman's uterus sheds. This cycle is part of a woman's reproductive system and prepares the body for a possible pregnancy.</p>
